body {
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100%;
  margin: 0;

  margin: 0.5rem 0;

/* NOTES CSS:
1. vh unit stands for viewport height, and is equal to 1% of the viewport.
2. to get rid of the horizontal scroll-bar, add a margin with the value set to 0 for the body tag.
3. As label elements are inline by default, they are all displayed side by side on the same line, making their text hard to read. To make them appear on separate lines, add display: block to the label element, and add a margin of 0.5rem 0, to separate them from each other.
